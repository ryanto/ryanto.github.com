  <p>Sam and I just published a landing page for
<a href="https://embermap.com">EmberMap</a>, a series of always up to date Ember
videos that help teams stay current.  If you'd like early access to our
videos we've got a sign up form on the website.</p>

<p>We created the landing page using Ember.js and we found a few benefits
in doing so.</p>

<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

<p>Deployment was really easy. We're using
<a href="http://ember-cli.com/ember-cli-deploy/">ember-cli-deploy</a> to deploy the
application to CloudFront. It took about 10 lines of code to set this up
and now all of our content is being served from a CDN with edge nodes on
five continents.</p>

<p>We're serving our index.html from the CDN as well, which comes with a
downside: Redeploys take about 15 minutes since we need to do cache
invalidation. However, the landing page content rarely changes, about
once every two days so far, so this is acceptable. When we get to a
point where we need to deploy multiple times a day we'll reconfigure
ember-cli-deploy to use another strategy for our index.html, but keep
the rest of our deployment pipeline the same. These sort of changes are
minimal and that keeps them easy.</p>

<h3 id="iteration">Iteration</h3>

<p>Currently our website is only a landing page, but we've got plans to
turn it into an application. However, there's no magic moment when we
suddenly have an application. By using Ember we can incrementally add
features and improve content over time. In a couple of weeks we'll be
adding an interactive video player to the home page. When that time
comes we won't have to throw away any code and start over, we'll simply
add our video player component to the home page.</p>

<h3 id="addons">Addons</h3>

<p>We wanted to collect metrics for how people interact with the site. This
enables us to see how visitors progress through our funnel as well as A/B
test different content. Setting this up was as easy thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/poteto/ember-metrics">ember-metrics</a>.</p>

<p>We also wanted to add animations, <a href="https://github.com/ember-animation/liquid-fire">liquid
fire</a> made that easy.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mitchlloyd/ember-screen">Ember screen</a> made it easy
for us to use different content on different devices and screen sizes.
No media queries or CSS hacks required for responsive content.</p>

<p>When I look at our page most of the hard-to-code things are handled by
addons. This lets us focus on content and allows us to publish quickly.</p>

<p>As we add more features to the page we'll look to addons to help us.
The Ember community does an amazing job keeping addons simple, well
documented, up to date, and developer friendly.</p>

<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade offs</h2>

<p>Of course there are trade offs when using Ember to build your landing page.
Here's a few of the downsides we had to consider when building the
landing page.</p>

<p>Ember is a JavaScript framework and that means the browser has to
download, parse, and execute JS code before any content is rendered.
This is added overhead when compared to serving a landing page as static
HTML. Our site is targeted at developers with fast Internet and modern
browsers, so we felt like this trade off was an acceptable one.</p>

<p>Ember isn't something you learn in a day. We've built many Ember apps in
the last four years so creating this one only took a few hours. Without
experience it's easy to run into questions that are hard to answer.
This sort of complexity significantly slows down development and should
always be considered when picking a tool.</p>

<p>All programming decisions involve some sort of trade off to be made.
While these trade offs might be non starters for your landing page we
felt the benefit of addons and feature iteration made them well worth
it.</p>
